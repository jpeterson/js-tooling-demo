#JavaScript Tooling
##Love Your Development Workflow


Let's talk about how we develop JavaScript apps. Toss aside Notepad and IE—it's time we got serious about this. 
Chrome Dev Tools, Postman, Grunt, Bower, SASS/Stylus, Sublime Text, JSHint... the list of tools grows every day. 
Once you learn to love your tools and get cozy with the command line, you'll be churning out apps faster than you can say "cross-browser compatibility."

Note: These samples were prepared for the 2014 Esri International Developer Summit and are geared toward 
the demo theater format. For the accompanying slides, head over to https://github.com/jpeterson/js-tooling-talk.

##What is this?

The purpose of this repo is to give a basic introduction to a few tools that can streamline your JS Workflow. The app itself is borrowed from Al Laframboise's sweet template (http://esri.github.io/bootstrap-map-js/demo/media.html).

Once you familiarize yourself with the basic app, check out the other guys to see how you can add Bower, Stylus, and Grunt into the workflow to help yourself out.
